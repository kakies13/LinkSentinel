# Privacy Policy for LinkSentinel

**Last Updated:** January 2026

LinkSentinel ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

LinkSentinel operates entirely **offline** within your browser. 
*   We do **not** track your browsing history.
*   We do **not** send the URLs you visit to any external server.
*   We do **not** collect personal identification information (PII).

## 2. How It Works

Heuristic analysis of links occurs locally on your device using JavaScript algorithms embedded in the extension. No data leaves your machine during this process.

## 3. Storage Permission

We use the `storage` permission solely to save your local preferences:
*   Extension ON/OFF state.
*   Your custom trusted sites (Whitelist).
*   The last scanned link result (temporarily stored locally for display in the popup).

## 4. Third-Party Services

LinkSentinel does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics).

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
